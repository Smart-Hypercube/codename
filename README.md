# codename
Generates random codenames for your projects.

Install `codename` to your `$PATH`. Then run `codename` or `codename 3`.

## Examples
- DH-09
- MP-91
- PX-92
- LP-04
- FE-18

## Why use codenames instead of proper names?
- It enables you to quickly start prototyping ideas and not blocked by naming.
- You may change your idea when prototyping. A proper name may soon be outdated, but a codename without meaning does not need to be changed.
- When having multiple similar projects, it helps to clearly distinguish them.
- It can be easily used as filename or variable name without needs to worry about naming conflicts or reserved keywords.
- It can be full-text searched and replaced without getting many irrelevant results.
- It leaks no information when accidentally exposed.

## Why choose this format?
It's easy to pronounce and be familiarized with.
